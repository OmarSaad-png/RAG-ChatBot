ayed'[26]to the learning algorithm.Model-based methods can be more computationally intensive than model-free approaches, and their utility can be limited by the extent to which the Markov Decision Process can be learnt.[27]There are other ways to use models than to update a value function.[28]For instance, inmodel predictive controlthe model is used to update the behavior directly.Theory[edit]Both the asymptotic and finite-sample behaviors of most algorithms are well understood. Algorithms with provably good online performance (addressing the exploration issue) are known.Efficient exploration of Markov decision processes is given in Burnetas and Katehakis (1997).[12]Finite-time performance bounds have also appeared for many algorithms, but these bounds are expected to be rather loose and thus more work is needed to better understand the relative advantages and limitations.For incremental algorithms, asymptotic convergence issues have been settled[clarification needed]. Temporal-difference-based algorithms converge under a wider set of conditions than was previously possible (for example, when used with arbitrary, smooth function approximation).Research[edit]This sectionneeds additional citations forverification.Please helpimprove this articlebyadding citations to reliable sourcesin this section.

In associative reinforcement learning tasks, the learning system interacts in a closed loop with its environment.[46]Deep reinforcement learning[edit]This approach extends reinforcement learning by using a deep neural network and without explicitly designing the state space.[47]The work on learning ATARI games by GoogleDeepMindincreased attention todeep reinforcement learningorend-to-end reinforcement learning.[48]Adversarial deep reinforcement learning[edit]Adversarial deep reinforcement learning is an active area of research in reinforcement learning focusing on vulnerabilities of learned policies. In this research area some studies initially showed that reinforcement learning policies are susceptible to imperceptible adversarial manipulations.[49][50][51]While some methods have been proposed to overcome these susceptibilities, in the most recent studies it has been shown that these proposed solutions are far from providing an accurate representation of current vulnerabilities of deep reinforcement learning policies.[52]Fuz
