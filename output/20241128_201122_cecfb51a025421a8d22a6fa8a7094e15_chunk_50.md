Reinforcement learning is one of thethree basic machine learning paradigms, alongsidesupervised learningandunsupervised learning.Q-learningat its simplest stores data in tables. This approach becomesinfeasibleas the number of states/actions increases (e.g., if the state space or action space were continuous), as the probability of the agent visiting a particular state and performing a particular action diminishes.Reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning in not needing labelled input-output pairs to be presented, and in not needing sub-optimal actions to be explicitly corrected. Instead, the focus is on finding a balance between exploration (of uncharted territory) and exploitation (of current knowledge) with the goal of maximizing the cumulative reward (the feedback of which might be incomplete or delayed).[1]The search for this balance is known as theexploration-exploitation dilemma.The environment is typically stated in the form of aMarkov decision process(MDP), as many reinforcement learning algorithms usedynamic programmingtechniques.[2]The main difference between classical dynamic programming methods and reinforcement learning algorithms is that the latter do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the Markov decision process, and they target large MDPs where exact methods become infeasible.[3]Introduction[edit]The typical framing of a Reinforcement Learning (RL) scenario: an agent takes actions in an environment, which is interpreted into a reward and a state representation, which are fed back to the agent.Due to its generality, reinforcement learning is studied in many disciplines, such asgame theory,control theory,operations research,information theory,simulation-based optimization,multi-agent systems,swarm intelligence, andstatistics. In the operations research and control literature, RL is calledapproximate dynamic programming, orneuro-dynamic programming.The problems of interest in RL have also been studied in thetheory of optimal control, which is concerned mostly with the existence and characterization of optimal solutions, and algorithm
