This is similar toprocessesthat appear to occur in animal psychology. For example, biological brains are hardwired to interpret signals such as pain and hunger as negative reinforcements, and interpret pleasure and food intake as positive reinforcements. In some circumstances, animals learn to adopt behaviors that optimize these rewards. This suggests that animals are capable of reinforcement learning.[4][5]A basic reinforcement learning agent interacts with its environment in discrete time steps. At each time stept, the agent receives the current stateSt{\displaystyle S_{t}}and rewardRt{\displaystyle R_{t}}. It then chooses an actionAt{\displaystyle A_{t}}from the set of available actions, which is subsequently sent to the environment. The environment moves to a new stateSt+1
