researchList of datasets in computer vision and image processingOutline of machine learningvteReinforcement learning(RL) is an interdisciplinary area ofmachine learningandoptimal controlconcerned with how anintelligent agentshouldtake actionsin a dynamic environment in order tomaximize a rewardsignal. Reinforcement learning is one of thethree basic machine learning paradigms, alongsidesupervised learningandunsupervised learning.Q-learningat its simplest stores data in tables. This approach becomesinfeasibleas the number of states/actions increases (e.g., if the state space or action space were continuous), as the probability of the agent visiting a particular state and performing a particular action diminishes.Reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning in not needing labelled input-output pairs to be presented, and in not needing sub-optimal actions to be explicitly corrected. Instead, the focus is on finding a balance between exploration (of uncharted territory) and exploitation (of current knowledge) with the goal of maximizing the cumulative reward (the feedback of which might be incomplete or delayed).[1]The search for this balance is known as theexploration-exploitation dilemma.The environment is typically stated in the form of aMarkov decision process(MDP), as many reinforcement learning algorithms usedynamic programmingtechniques.[2]The main difference between classical dynamic programming methods and reinforcement learning algorithms is that the latter do
