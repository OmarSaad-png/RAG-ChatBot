a deterministic policy but randomness in observed behavior is due to the fact that an observer only has partial access to the features the observed agent uses in decision making. The utility function is modeled as a random variable to account for the ignorance of the observer regarding the features the observed agent actually considers in its utility function.Safe reinforcement learning[edit]Safe reinforcement learning (SRL) can be defined as the process of learning policies that maximize the expectation of the return in problems in which it is important to ensure reasonable system performance and/or respect safety constraints during the learning and/or deployment processes.[58]An alternative approach is risk-averse reinforcement learning, where instead of theexpectedreturn, arisk-measureof the return is optimized, such as theConditional Value at Risk(CVaR).[59]In addition to mitigating risk, the CVaR objective increases robustness to model uncertainties.[60][61]However, CVaR optimization in risk-averse RL requires special care, to prevent gradient bias[62]and blindness to suc
