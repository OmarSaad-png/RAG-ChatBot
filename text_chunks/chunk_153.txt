In associative reinforcement learning tasks, the learning system interacts in a closed loop with its environment.[46]Deep reinforcement learning[edit]This approach extends reinforcement learning by using a deep neural network and without explicitly designing the state space.[47]The work on learning ATARI games by GoogleDeepMindincreased attention todeep reinforcement learningorend-to-end reinforcement
