with a mapping from a finite-dimensional (parameter) space to the space of policies: given the parameter vector{\displaystyle \theta }, let{\displaystyle \pi _{\theta }}denote the policy associated to{\displaystyle \theta }. Defining the performance function by()={\displaystyle \rho (\theta )=\rho ^{\pi _{\theta }}}under mild conditions this function will be differentiable as a function of the parameter vector{\displaystyle \theta }. If the gradient of{\displaystyle \rho }was known, one could usegradient ascent. Since an analytic expression for the gradient is not available, only a noisy estimate is available. Such an estimate can be constructed in many ways, giving rise to algorithms such as Williams' REINFORCE method[21](which is known as the likelihood ratio method in thesimulation-based optimizationliterature).[22]A large class of methods avoids relying on gradient information. These includesimulated annealing,cross-entropy searchor methods ofevolutionary computation. Many gradient-free methods can achieve (in theory and in the limit) a global optimum.Policy search methods may converge slowly given noisy data. For example, this happens in episodic problems when the trajectories are long and the variance of the returns is large. Value-function based methods that rely on temporal differences might help in this case. In recent years,actorcritic methodshave been proposed and performed well on various problems.[23]Policy search methods have been used in
