both decisions about actions and emotions (feelings) about consequence states. The system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion.[66]Statistical comparison of reinforcement learning algorithms[edit]Efficient comparison of RL algorithms is essential for research, deployment and monitoring of RL systems. To compare different algorithms on a given environment, an agent can be trained for each algorithm. Since the performance is sensitive to implementation details, all algorithms should be implemented as closely as possible to each other.[67]After the training is finished, the agents can be run on a sample of test episodes, and their scores (returns) can be compared. Since episodes are typically assumed to bei.i.d, standard statistical tools can be used for hypothesis testing, such asT-testandpermutation test.[68]This requires to accumulate all the rewards within an episode into a single number - the episodic return. However, this causes a loss of information, as different time-steps are averaged together, possibly with different levels of noise. Whenev
