computation in TD methods can be incremental (when after each transition the memory is changed and the transition is thrown away), or batch (when the transitions are batched and the estimates are computed once based on the batch). Batch methods, such as the least-squares temporal difference method,[18]may use the information in the samples better, while incremental methods are the only choice when batch methods are infeasible due to their high computational or memory complexity. Some methods try to combine the two approaches. Methods based on temporal differences also overcome the fourth issue.Another problem specific to TD comes from their reliance on the recursive Bellman equation. Most TD methods have a so-called{\displaystyle \lambda }parameter(01){\displaystyle (0\leq \lambda \leq 1)}that can continuously interpolate between Monte Carlo methods that do not rely on the Bellman equations and the basic TD methods that rely entirely on the Bellman equations. This can be effective in palliating this issue.Function approximation methods[edit]In order to address the fifth issue,function approximation methodsare used.Linear function approximationstarts with a mapping{\displaystyle \phi }that assigns a finite-dimensional vector to each state-action pair. Then, the action values of a state-action pair(s,a){\displaystyle (s,a)}are obtained by linearly combining the components of(s,a){\displaystyle \phi (s,a)}with someweights{\displaystyle \theta }:Q(s,a)=i=1dii(s,a).{\displaystyle
