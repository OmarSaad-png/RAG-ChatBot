action-value functionand is commonly denoted byQ{\displaystyle Q^{*}}. In summary, the knowledge of the optimal action-value function alone suffices to know how to act optimally.Assuming full knowledge of the Markov decision process, the two basic approaches to compute the optimal action-value function arevalue iterationandpolicy iteration. Both algorithms compute a sequence of functionsQk{\displaystyle Q_{k}}(k=0,1,2,{\displaystyle k=0,1,2,\ldots }) that converge toQ{\displaystyle Q^{*}}. Computing these functions involves computing expectations over the whole state-space, which is impractical for all but the smallest (finite) Markov decision processes. In reinforcement learning methods, expectations are approximated by averaging over samples and using function approximation techniques to cope with the need to represent value functions over large state-action spaces.Monte Carlo methods[edit]Monte Carlo methods[15]are used to solve reinforcement learning problems by averaging sample returns. Unlike methods that require full knowledge of the environments dynamics, Monte Car
