large, which requires many samples to accurately estimate the discounted return of each policy. These problems can be ameliorated if we assume some structure and allow samples generated from one policy to influence the estimates made for others. The two main approaches for achieving this are value function estimation and direct policy search. Value function approaches attempt to find a policy that maximizes the discounted return by maintaining a set of estimates of expected discounted returns E  [ G ] {\displaystyle \operatorname {\mathbb {E} } [G]} for some policy (usually either the "current" [on-policy] or the optimal [off-policy] one). These methods r
