=Pr(At=aSt=s){\displaystyle \pi (s,a)=\Pr(A_{t}=a\mid S_{t}=s)}that maximizes the expected cumulative reward.Formulating the problem as a Markov decision process assumes the agent directly observes the current environmental state; in this case, the problem is said to havefull observability. If the agent only has access to a subset of states, or if the observed states are corrupted by noise, the agent is said to havepartial observability, and formally the problem must be formulated as apartially observable Markov decision process. In both cases, the set of actions available to the agent can be restricted. For example, the state of an account balance could be restricted to be positive; if the current value of the state is 3 and the state transition attempts to reduce the value by 4, the transition will not be allowed.When the agent's performance is compared to that of an agent that acts optimally, the difference in performance yields the notion ofregret. In order to act near optimally, the agent must reason about long-term consequences of its actions (i.e., maximize future rewards), although the immediate reward associated with this might be negative.Thus, reinforcement learning is particularly well-suited to problems that include a long-term versus short-term reward trade-off. It has been applied successfully to various problems, includingenergy storage,[6]robot control,[7]photovoltaic generators,[8]backgammon,checkers,[9]Go(AlphaGo), andautonomous driving systems.[10]Two
