the problemnon-stationary. To address this non-stationarity, Monte Carlo methods use the framework of general policy iteration (GPI). While dynamic programming computesvalue functionsusing full knowledge of theMarkov decision process(MDP), Monte Carlo methods learn these functions through sample returns. The value functions and policies interact similarly to dynamic programming to achieveoptimality, first addressing the prediction problem and then extending to policy improvement and control, all based on sampled experience.[14]Temporal difference methods[edit]Main article:Temporal difference learningThe first problem is corrected by allowing the procedure to change the policy (at some or all states) before the values settle. This too may be problematic as it might prevent convergence. Most current algorithms do this, giving rise to the class ofgeneralized policy iterationalgorithms. Manyactor-criticmethods belong to this category.The second issue can be corrected by allowing trajectories to contribute to any state-action pair in them. This may also help to some extent with the third proble
