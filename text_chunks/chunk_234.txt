reinforcement learning algorithms usedynamic programmingtechniques.[2]The main difference between classical dynamic programming methods and reinforcement learning algorithms is that the latter do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the Markov decision process, and they target large MDPs where exact methods become infeasible.[3]Introduction[edit]The typical framing of a Reinforcement Learning (RL) scenario: an agent takes actions in an environment, which is interpreted into a reward and a state representation, which are fed back to the agent.Due to its generality, reinforcement learning is studied in many disciplines, such asgame theory,control theory,operations research,information theory,simulation-based optimization,multi-agent systems,swarm intelligence, andstatistics. In the operations research and control literature, RL is calledapproximate dynamic programming, orneuro-dynamic programming.The problems of interest in RL have also been studied in thetheory of optimal control, which is concerned mostly with the existence and characterization of optimal solutions, and algorithms for their exact computation, and less with learning or approximation (particularly in the absence of a mathematical model of the environment).Basic reinforcement learning is modeled as aMarkov decision process:A set of environment and agent states (the state space),S{\displaystyle {\mathcal {S}}};A set of actions (the action space),A{\displaystyle {\mathcal {A}}}, of the
