In associative reinforcement learning tasks, the learning system interacts in a closed loop with its environment.[46]Deep reinforcement learning[edit]This approach extends reinforcement learning by using a deep neural network and without explicitly designing the state space.[47]The work on learning ATARI games by GoogleDeepMindincreased attention todeep reinforcement learningorend-to-end reinforcement learning.[48]Adversarial deep reinforcement learning[edit]Adversarial deep reinforcement learning is an active area of research in reinforcement learning focusing on vulnerabilities of learned policies. In this research area some studies initially showed that reinforcement learning policies are susceptible to imperceptible adversarial manipulations.[49][50][51]While some methods have been proposed to overcome these susceptibilities, in the most recent studies it has been shown that these
