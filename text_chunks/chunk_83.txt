From the theory of Markov decision processes it is known that, without loss of generality, the search can be restricted to the set of so-calledstationarypolicies. A policy isstationaryif the action-distribution returned by it depends only on the last state visited (from the observation agent's history). The search can be further restricted todeterministicstationary policies. Adeterministic stationarypolicy deterministically selects actions based on the current state. Since any such policy can be identified with a mapping from the set of states to the set of actions, these policies can be identified with such mappings with no loss of generality.Brute force[edit]Thebrute forceapproach entails two steps:For each possible policy, sample returns while
