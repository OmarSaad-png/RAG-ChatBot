ding the features the observed agent actually considers in its utility function.Safe reinforcement learning[edit]Safe reinforcement learning (SRL) can be defined as the process of learning policies that maximize the expectation of the return in problems in which it is important to ensure reasonable system performance and/or respect safety constraints during the learning and/or deployment processes.[58]An alternative approach is risk-averse reinforcement learning, where instead of theexpectedreturn, arisk-measureof the return is optimized, such as theConditional Value at Risk(CVaR).[59]In addition to mitigating risk, the CVaR objective increases robustness to model uncertainties.[60][61]However, CVaR optimization in risk-averse RL requires special care, to prevent gradient bias[62]and blindness to success.[63]Self-reinforcement learning[edit]Self-reinforcement learning (or self learning), is a learning paradigm which does not use the concept of immediate reward Ra(s,s') after transition from s to s' with action a. It does not use an external reinforcement, it only uses the agent internal self-reinforcement. The internal self-reinforcement is provided by mechanism of feelings and emotions. In the learning process emotions are backpropagated by a mechanism of secondary reinforcement. The learning equation does not include the immediate reward, it only includes the state evaluation.The self-reinforcement algorithm updates a memory matrix W =||w(a,s)|| such that in each iteration
