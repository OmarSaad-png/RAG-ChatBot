in reinforcement learning,[53] approximating the state-action value function with fuzzy rules in continuous space becomes possible. The IF - THEN form of fuzzy rules make this approach suitable for expressing the results in a form close to natural language. Extending FRL with Fuzzy Rule Interpolation [54] allows the use of reduced size sparse fuzzy rule-bases to emphasize cardinal rules (most important state-action values). In inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), no reward function is given. Instead, the reward function is inferred given an observed behavior from an expert. The idea is to mimic observed behavior, which is often optimal or close to optimal.[55] One popular IRL paradigm is named maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning (MaxEnt IRL). [56] MaxEnt IRL estimates the parameters of a linear model of the reward function by maximizing the entropy of the probability distribution of observed trajectories subject to constraints related to matching expected feature counts. Recently it has been shown that MaxEnt IRL is a particular case of a more general framework named random utility inverse reinforcement learning (RU-IRL). [57] RU-IRL is based on random utility theory and Markov decision processes. While prior IRL approaches assume that the apparent random behavior of an observed agent is due to it following a random policy, RU-IRL assumes that the observed agent follows a deterministic policy but randomness in observed behavior is due to the fact that an observer
