without reference to an estimated probability distribution, shows poor performance. The case of (small) finite Markov decision processes is relatively well understood. However, due to the lack of algorithms that scale well with the number of states (or scale to problems with infinite state spaces), simple exploration methods are the most practical.One such method is{\displaystyle \varepsilon }-greedy, where0<<1{\displaystyle 0<\varepsilon <1}is a parameter controlling the amount of exploration vs. exploitation. With probability1{\displaystyle 1-\varepsilon }, exploitation is chosen, and the agent chooses the action that it believes has the best long-term effect (ties between actions are broken uniformly at random). Alternatively, with probability{\displaystyle \varepsilon }, exploration is chosen, and the action is chosen uniformly at random.{\displaystyle \varepsilon }is usually a fixed parameter but can be adjusted either according to a schedule (making the agent explore progressively less), or adaptively based on heuristics.[13]Algorithms for control learning[edit]Even if the issue of exploration is disregarded and even if the state was observable (assumed hereafter), the problem remains to use past experience to find out which actions lead to higher cumulative rewards.Criterion of optimality[edit]Policy[edit]The agent's action selection is modeled as a map calledpolicy::AS[0,1]{\displaystyle \pi :{\mathcal {A}}\times {\mathcal {S}}\rightarrow
