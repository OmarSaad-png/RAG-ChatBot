estimates "how good" it is to be in a given state.[14]: 60 where the random variable G {\displaystyle G} denotes the discounted return, and is defined as the sum of future discounted rewards: where R t + 1 {\displaystyle R_{t+1}} is the reward for transitioning from state S t {\displaystyle S_{t}} to S t + 1 {\displaystyle S_{t+1}} , 0   < 1 {\displaystyle 0\leq \gamma <1} is the discount rate.  {\displaystyle \gamma } is less than 1, so rewards in the distant future are weighted less than rewards in the immediate future. The algorithm must find a policy with maximum expected discounted return. From the theory of Markov decision processes it is known that, without loss of generality, the search can be restricted to the set of so-called stationary policies. A policy is stationary if the action-distribution returned by it depends only on the last state visited (from the observation agent's history). The search can be further restricted to deterministic stationary policies. A deterministic stationary policy deterministically selects actions based on the current state. Since any such policy can be identified with a mapping from the set of states to the set of actions, these policies can be identified with such mappings with no loss of generality. The brute force approach entails two steps: One problem with this is that the number of policies can be large, or even infinite. Another is that the variance of the returns may be large, which requires many samples to accurately
