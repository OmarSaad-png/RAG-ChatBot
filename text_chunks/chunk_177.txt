Both algorithms compute a sequence of functionsQk{\displaystyle Q_{k}}(k=0,1,2,{\displaystyle k=0,1,2,\ldots }) that converge toQ{\displaystyle Q^{*}}. Computing these functions involves computing expectations over the whole state-space, which is impractical for all but the smallest (finite) Markov decision processes. In reinforcement learning methods, expectations are approximated by averaging over samples and using function approximation techniques to cope with the need to represent value functions over large state-action spaces.Monte Carlo methods[edit]Monte Carlo methods[15]are used to solve reinforcement learning problems by averaging sample returns. Unlike methods that require full knowledge of the environments dynamics, Monte Carlo methods rely solely on actual orsimulatedexperiencesequences of states, actions, and rewards obtained from interaction with an environment. This makes them applicable in situations where the complete dynamics are unknown. Learning from actual experience does not require prior knowledge of the environment and can still lead to optimal behavior. When using simulated experience, only a model capable of generating sample transitions is required, rather than a full specification oftransition probabilities, which is necessary fordynamic programmingmethods.Monte Carlo methods apply to episodic tasks, where experience is divided into episodes that eventually terminate.
