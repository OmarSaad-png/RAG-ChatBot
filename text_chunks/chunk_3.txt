these rewards. This suggests that animals are capable of reinforcement learning.[4][5] A basic reinforcement learning agent interacts with its environment in discrete time steps. At each time step t, the agent receives the current state S t {\displaystyle S_{t}} and reward R t {\displaystyle R_{t}} . It then chooses an action A t {\displaystyle A_{t}} from the set of available actions, which is subsequently sent to the environment. The environment moves to a new state S t + 1 {\displaystyle S_{t+1}} and the reward R t + 1 {\displaystyle R_{t+1}} associated with the transition ( S t , A t , S t + 1 ) {\displaystyle (S_{t},A_{t},S_{t+1})} is determined. The goal of a reinforcement learning agent is to learn a policy:  : S  A  [ 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle \pi :{\mathcal {S}}\times {\mathcal {A}}\rightarrow [0,1]} ,  ( s , a ) = Pr ( A t = a  S t = s ) {\displaystyle \pi (s,a)=\Pr(A_{t}=a\mid S_{t}=s)} that maximizes the expected cumulative reward. Formulating the problem as a Markov decision process assumes the agent directly observes the current environmental state; in this case, the problem is said to have full observability. If the agent only has access to a subset of states, or if the observed states are corrupted by noise, the agent is said to have partial observability, and formally the problem must be formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process. In both cases, the set of actions available to the agent can be restricted. For example, the state of an account
