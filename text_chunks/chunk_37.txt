Including Deep Q-learning methods when a neural network is used to represent Q, with various applications in stochastic search problems.[20]The problem with using action-values is that they may need highly precise estimates of the competing action values that can be hard to obtain when the returns are noisy, though this problem is mitigated to some extent by temporal difference methods. Using the so-called compatible function approximation method compromises generality and efficiency.Direct policy search[edit]An alternative method is to search directly in (some subset of) the policy space, in which case the problem becomes a case ofstochastic optimization. The two approaches available are gradient-based and gradient-free methods.Gradient-based methods (policy gradient methods) start with a mapping from a finite-dimensional (parameter) space to the space of policies: given the parameter vector{\displaystyle \theta }, let{\displaystyle \pi _{\theta }}denote the policy associated to{\displaystyle \theta }. Defining the performance function by()={\displaystyle \rho (\theta )=\rho ^{\pi _{\theta }}}under mild conditions this function will be differentiable as a function of the parameter vector{\displaystyle \theta }. If the gradient of{\displaystyle \rho }was known, one could usegradient ascent. Since an analytic expression for the gradient is not available, only a noisy estimate is available. Such an estimate can be constructed in many ways, giving rise to algorithms such as
