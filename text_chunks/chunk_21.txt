Reinforcement learning is one of thethree basic machine learning paradigms, alongsidesupervised learningandunsupervised learning.Q-learningat its simplest stores data in tables. This approach becomesinfeasibleas the number of states/actions increases (e.g., if the state space or action space were continuous), as the probability of the agent visiting a particular state and performing a particular action diminishes.Reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning in not needing labelled input-output pairs to be presented, and in not needing sub-optimal actions to be explicitly corrected. Instead, the focus is on finding a balance between exploration (of uncharted territory) and
